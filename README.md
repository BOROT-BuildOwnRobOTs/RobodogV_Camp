# Introduction to  Computer Vision with Bittle Robot 

Introduction to Python and Computer Vision with Bittle Robot
Welcome to our comprehensive 5-day course designed to blend the realms of Python programming and computer vision to control robots effectively. This README provides an overview of the course structure, objectives, and the key concepts you'll be exploring. Our primary goal is to apply computer vision techniques to navigate and control robots, focusing on hands-on learning and practical applications.

## Course Overview
This course spans over five days, each dedicated to a specific set of skills and knowledge areas necessary for mastering the integration of computer vision with robotics:

**Day 1: Introduction to GitHub , Basic Linux Commands and Python Basics I**
  
  - Get familiar with version control using GitHub and navigate through Linux environments using command-line tools. This foundation is crucial for software development and deployment.

**Day 2: Python Basics II**
  
  - Dive into Python programming, covering essential syntax, data structures, and programming concepts. Python's simplicity and power make it the perfect language for beginners and experts alike.

**Day 3: Image Processing and Computer Vision Fundamentals**

  - Explore the basics of image processing and how computer vision algorithms can interpret and understand visual data. This knowledge is key to enabling robots to make sense of their surroundings.

**Day 4: Introduction to AI with Teachable Machine**

  - Learn about artificial intelligence through Teachable Machine, a tool that allows you to create simple AI models. This will serve as an introduction to how machines can learn from visual data.

**Day 5: Controlling Robots with Computer Vision**
  
  -Apply your newfound knowledge to control Bittle, a versatile and agile robot dog, using computer vision. This session will focus on integrating image processing algorithms with robotics control.
