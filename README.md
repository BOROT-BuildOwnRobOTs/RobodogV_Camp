# Introduction to Computer Vision with Python - Day 3
Welcome to Day 3 of our Python Programming Course! Today, we're embarking on an exploration of Computer Vision, focusing on image processing using the OpenCV library. This session will introduce you to the basics of handling and manipulating visual data through coding. Prepare to unlock new capabilities in processing and analyzing images with Python.

## Setting Up
To ensure you're fully prepared for today's lessons, follow these steps to install the necessary software and set up your environment:

## Install OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a crucial tool for computer vision applications. To install OpenCV-Python, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
 ```
If your `pip` is not up-to-date, upgrade it first:


```bash

pip install --upgrade pip
 ```

### Clone the Course Repository
If this is your first time setting up, you'll need to clone the course repository:
 
```bash

git clone https://github.com/pannatron/RobodogV_Camp.git
 ```

Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash

cd RobodogV_Camp
 ```

Switch to the Day 3 branch to access the materials prepared for today:

```bash
git checkout day3

```
## Day 3 Exercises Overview
In today's session, you will learn fundamental techniques for image processing with OpenCV, including:
 - Reading Images from Files and Cameras: Learn how to load images not only from files but also directly from cameras, enabling real-time image processing.
 - Color Spaces - RGB, Grey, and HSV: Understand the different color spaces commonly used in image processing, including RGB (Red, Green, Blue), Greyscale, and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value). Each color space serves different purposes and applications in computer vision.
 - Edge Detection: Explore methods to detect edges within images, which is crucial for object detection and other image analysis applications.
 - Morphological Transformations: Study the techniques to process geometric structures in the image, essential for shape analysis and other advanced processing tasks.
## Getting Started with OpenCV
1. Reading and Writing Images
Begin by learning to handle image files:
```bash
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Image Title', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
